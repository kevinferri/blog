Hey, my name is Kevin. I live and work in Manhattan.

I'm currently a Web Developer for [Appboy](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/appboy).

I'm a passionate developer always looking for more difficult problems to solve.

I have extensive experience with JavaScript (client & server), HTML5, and CSS3. I also enjoy working with the Java and Go programming languages.
