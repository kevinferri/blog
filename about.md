Hey, my name is Kevin. I live and work in Manhattan.

I'm currently a Frontend Developer for [Appboy](http://appboy.com).

I'm a passionate developer always looking for more difficult problems to solve. I have two years of professional development experience and have been programming for five years.

I have extensive experience with JavaScript (client & server), HTML5, and CSS3. I also enjoy working with the Java and Go programming languages.
